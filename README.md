## FAQ

### How Do I Use This?

There are two ways you can use BiblioReads:

1. Visit [biblioreads.netlify.app](biblioreads.netlify.app) and paste the GoodReads book url into the input box.
2. Replace the `https://www.goodreads.com` of any book page with `biblioreads.netlify.app`. Then click the "Fetch Data" button. For example: [www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit) to [biblioreads.netlify.app/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit](https://biblioreads.netlify.app/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit).

### How Does This Work? - Scraping

Since Goodreads stopped issuing new developer keys for their [public developer API](https://www.goodreads.com/api) back in December of 2020 and plans to retire the current version of the their API which you can learn more about [here](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/Does-Goodreads-support-the-use-of-APIs). BiblioReads, goes to the Goodreads book page and scrapes the required content.

### Why Is This Slower Than Goodreads?

When you make a request for a book on BiblioReads, your request needs to be first scraped by the scraper from Goodreads before the result can be shown to you. This causes a delay from when you make the request to when the result is shown.

### What Do You Do With My Data?

Nothing. Since we don't collect any user data we can't use it

### Why Is This Missing Functionality?

BiblioReads, is still a work in progress and new functionality is continually being developed. If you have a certain feature that you would like to see, feel free to open an issue on GitHub
