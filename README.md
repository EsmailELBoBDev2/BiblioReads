## FAQ

### How Do I Use This?
There are two ways you can use BiblioReads:
- Visit [biblioreads.netlify.app](biblioreads.netlify.app) and paste the GoodReads book url into the input box. 
Or
- Prepend the Goodreads URL of any book page with `biblioreads.netlify.app/?path=`. Then click the "Fetch Data" button. For example: '[www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit)' to '[biblioreads.netlify.app/?path=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit](https://biblioreads.netlify.app/?path=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5907.The_Hobbit)'.  

### How Does This Work? - Scraping
Since Goodreads stopped issuing new developer keys for their [public developer API](https://www.goodreads.com/api) back in December of 2020 and plans to retire the current version of the their API which you can learn more about [here](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/Does-Goodreads-support-the-use-of-APIs). BiblioReads, goes to the Goodreads book page and scrapes the required content. 

### Why Is This Slower Than Goodreads?
When you make a request for a book on BiblioReads, your request needs to be first scraped by the scraper from Goodreads before the result can be shown to you. This causes a delay from when you make the request to when the result is shown.
